            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> Life as everyone knew it transformed completely. People are no longer allowed to go out in public and interact as they once did. No one can even leave their house without having to grab a mask. Gathering have been limited to 10 people or less. Restaurants in Colorado limit groups to a maximum of 8 people. Restaurants, bars, stores, and other businesses have had to restrict the amount of people allowed in their establishments and reduce their capacity. Our ability to socialize and interact with each other has been completely changed. Instead of meeting in person, many people have resorted to having virtual happy hours, or socially distanced gatherings where everyone must stay 6 feet apart and wear masks. All the restrictions have hit many people hard, increasing feelings of isolation and frustration.

            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>The COVID-19 pandemic also caused incredible economic distress all over the world. Many countries instituted a lock-down, requiring all citizens to stay inside to slow down the spread of the virus. This caused a lot of people to be furloughed or fired due to the uncertainty surrounding the future, and as the lock-down dragged on more people became unemployed.

        <p class="bg-light border border-top-5px border-info p-1">
            The United States government and other countries gave its citizens a stimulus check to try and keep people afloat over summer. The uncertainty has also had a very large impact on the stock market. Stocks rise and drop by incredible amounts based on news about COVID-19.

            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> The pandemic also allowed for unprecedented expansion of governmental powers. At least 84 countries have declared states of emergency enabling government’s powers that they normally do not have. These powers include banning protesting, postponing elections, enforcement of lockdown rules, and large-scale surveillance programs for contact tracing. Depending on how specific governments handled the pandemic there have been surges of leader popularity as well, in Italy, France and Germany government approval ratings have increased, while governmental approval ratings in the United States have fallen. <br>
            <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> There have also been many restrictions placed on imports and exports from other countries due to worries about the virus. China halted many imports of frozen food from other countries due to fears of COVID-19 transmission. Before this restriction, China’s customs authority requires signed declarations that any food product imports have not been contaminated by the virus. This has caused a strain on international relations between different countries.

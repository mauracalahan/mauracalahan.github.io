            </ul>
            <p>Sea otters sometimes hold hands while they're sleeping to keep from floating away from each other.
               Often a mother and pup will hold on to each other while they are resting so that they don't drift 
               off from each other or the rest of their group, which is called a raft. </p>

        </ul>
            <p>Elephant's can not jump because they simply do not need to. Many animals jump to get away from predators, but due to their size and tusks elephants never needed to jump. </p>

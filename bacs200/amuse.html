                <li>Sea otters hold hands to keep form drifting apart </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sea otters sometimes hold hands while they're sleeping to keep from floating away from each other.
               Often a mother and pup will hold on to each other while they are resting so that they don't drift 
               off from each other or the rest of their group, which is called a raft </p>

                 <li>Gentoo Penguins propose to their mate with a pebble </li>
            </ul>
            <p> These penguins live on rocky shores and prize these small stones to build their
               nests during mating season. During courtship, a male penguin will find the smoothest 
                pebble to give to a female as a gift.</p>

        </ul>
            <p>Elephant's can not jump because they simply do not need to. Many animals jump to get away from predators, but due to their suze and tusks elephants never needed to jump. </p>

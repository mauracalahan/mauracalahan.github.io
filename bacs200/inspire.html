        "What makes a hero? A hero is someone who inspires other to become better than they are.
        A Hero takes ordinary people and gives them the realization that one person can change
        the world if they work hard enough and never give up on their believes
        "

        The Hero I most admire has the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Brave- they face others who disagree with them and stand unwavering
            in their believes</li>
        <li>Integrity- they live their lives in accordance with their believes
            against pressure to change</li>
        <li>Sacrifice and Commitment- Often times those who try to change the
            world looses everything in the process</li>
        <li>An Inspiration to Others- Leads by example an inspires others to do the same</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Nelson Mandela exemplifies these values.
        He fought to end apartheid by trying to dismantel institutionalized
        racism and foster racial reconcilliation.
        Mandela faced an entire government trying to silence him, standing
        unwavering in his believes. He spent 27 years of
        his life imprisoned for trying to force change on a racist government.
        Today, Nelson Mandela's name is synonomous with activism.
        When searching for people who's name is known around the world for
        activism, Mandela's name is at the top of searches over 20
        years after his death.

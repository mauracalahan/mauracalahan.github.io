    "What makes a hero? A hero is someone who inspires other to become better than they are. A Hero takes ordinary people and gives them the realization that one person can change the world if they work hard enough and never give up on their believes
  "
</p>
<p>
  The Hero I most admire has the following characteristics.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Brave- they face others who disagree with them and stand unwavering in their believes</li>
  <li>Integrity- they live their lives in accordance with their believes against pressure to change</li>
  <li>Sacrifice and Commitment- Mandela spent 27 years of his life imprisoned for fighting for what he believed in</li>
  <li>An Inspiration to Others- Nelson Mandela's name is synonomous with activism
</ul>
<p>
  "Nelson Mandela exemplifies these values.
  He fought to end apartheid by trying to dismantel institutionalized racism and foster racial reconcilliation. 
  Mandela faced an entire government trying to silence him, standing unwavering in his believes. He spent 27 years of
  his life imprisoned for trying to force change on a racist government. Today, Nelson Mandela's name is synonomous with activism.
  When searching for people who's name is known around the world for activism, Mandela's name is at the top of searches over 20 
  years after his death."
